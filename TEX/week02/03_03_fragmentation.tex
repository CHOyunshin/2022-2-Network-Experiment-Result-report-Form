    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-9
        \item Find the first IP datagram containing the first part of the segment sent to 128.119.245.12 sent by your computer via the traceroute command to gaia.cs.umass.edu, after you specified that the traceroute packet length should be 3000. Has that segment been fragmented across more than one IP datagram?\\[0.2mm]
