    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-10
        \item Find the first ICMP Echo Request message that was sent by your computer 
        after you changed the Packet Size in pingplotter to be 2000. 
        Has that message been fragmented across more than one IP datagram? \\[0.2mm]

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-11
        \item Print out the first fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. 
        What information in the IP header indicates that the datagram been fragmented? 
        What information in the IP header indicates whether this is the first fragment versus a latter fragment? 
        How long is this IP datagram?\\[0.2mm]

        \item Print out the second fragment of the fragmented IP datagram. 
        What information in the IP header indicates that this is not the first datagram fragment? 
        Are the more fragments? How can you tell?\\[0.2mm]
