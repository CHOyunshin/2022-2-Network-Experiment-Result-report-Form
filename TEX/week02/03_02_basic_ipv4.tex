    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-6
        \item Which fields in the IP datagram always change from one datagram to the next within this series of UDP segments sent by your computer destined to 128.119.245.12, via traceroute? Why?\\[0.2mm]
        \soln Identification : Each IP datagram has different identification number, unless it is fragmented. \\
                Header Checksum : Checksum changes as the header changes. \\
                Time to Live : ‘traceroute’ increases TTL with each subsequent packet.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-7
        \item Which fields in this sequence of IP datagrams (containing UDP segments) stay constant? Why?\\[0.2mm]
        \soln Version : They are all IPv4 datagrams. \\
                Header Length : They are all UDP packets and have the same header length. \\
                Differentiated Services Field : They are all UDP packets and are in the same class. \\
                Protocol : They are all UDP packets. \\
                Source Address : They are all sent from the same source. \\
                Destination Address : They are all sent to the same destination.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 3-8
        \item Describe the pattern you see in the values in the Identification field of the IP datagrams being sent by your computer.\\[0.2mm]
        \soln The values in the identification field increment with each subsequent packet.
