    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 1-3
        \item What is the sequence number of the TCP SYN segment that is used to initiate the TCP connection between the client computer and gaia.cs.umass.edu? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYN segment?\\[0.2mm]
        \soln The sequence number of TCP SYN segment that is used to initate the TCP connection of that is the no.1 Segement in filtered packet list by keyword, ‘TCP’ is the value of 0.\\
        We can figure out that segment is a SYN segment as that of TCP header contains Flags value.

        \item What is the sequence number of the SYNACK segment sent by gaia.cs.umass.edu to the client computer in reply to the SYN? What is the value of the Acknowledgement field in the SYNACK segment? How did gaia.cs.umass.edu determine that value? What is it in the segment that identifies the segment as a SYNACK segment?\\[0.2mm]
        \soln The sequence number of the SYNACK segment is 0. \\\
        Acknowledgement field is the value of sequence number plus 1, 1.\\
        The message contains the information of this segment is the SYN,ACK segment as marked figure below.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 1-5
        \item What is the sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command? Note that in order to find the POST command, you’ll need to dig into the packet content field at the bottom of the Wireshark window, looking for a segment with a “POST” within its DATA field.\\[0.2mm]
        \soln The sequence number of the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST command is 164041.

    %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Problem 1-6
        \item Consider the TCP segment containing the HTTP POST as the first segment in the TCP connection. What are the sequence numbers of the first six segments in the TCP connection (including the segment containing the HTTP POST)? At what time was each segment sent? When was the ACK for each segment received? Given the difference between when each TCP segment was sent, and when its acknowledgement was received, what is the RTT value for each of the six segments? \\
        What is the EstimatedRTT value after the receipt of each ACK?\\
        Assume that the value of the EstimatedRTT is equal to the measured RTT for the first segment, and then is computed using the EstimatedRTT equation below for all subsequent segments.\\
        \begin{equation*}
            \text{Estimated RTT} = 0.875 \times \text{Estimated RTT} + 0.125 \times \text{Sample RTT}
        \end{equation*}
        \soln
        The first six segements are No. 4,5,7,8,10,11. And those of sequence number are 1, 566, 2026, 3486, 4946, 6406.\\

        The time of segment sent, segment received the ACK, and the value of RTT are taken table below. To know each of six segment’s ACK received time, the No. of  ACKs that segemnts received are  No. 6, 9,12,14,15,16.
